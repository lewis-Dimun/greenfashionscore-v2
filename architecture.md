# Architecture Overview
This document serves as a critical, living template designed to equip agents with a rapid and comprehensive understanding of the codebase's architecture, enabling efficient navigation and effective contribution from day one. Update this document as the codebase evolves.

## 1. Project Structure
This section provides a high-level overview of the project's directory and file structure, categorised by architectural layer or major functional area. It is essential for quickly navigating the codebase, locating relevant files, and understanding the overall organization and separation of concerns.

## 2. High-Level System Diagram
Provide a simple block diagram (e.g., a C4 Model Level 1: System Context diagram, or a basic component diagram) or a clear text-based description of the major components and their interactions. Focus on how data flows, services communicate, and key architectural boundaries.
 
[User] <--> [Frontend Application] <--> [Backend Service 1] <--> [Database 1]
                                    |
                                    +--> [Backend Service 2] <--> [External API]                           

## 3. Core Components
(List and briefly describe the main components of the system. For each, include its primary responsibility and key technologies used.)

### 3.1. Frontend

Name: [e.g., Web App, Mobile App]

Description: Briefly describe its primary purpose, key functionalities, and how users or other systems interact with it. E.g., 'The main user interface for interacting with the system, allowing users to manage their profiles, view data dashboards, and initiate workflows.'

Technologies: [e.g., React, Next.js, Vue.js, Swift/Kotlin, HTML/CSS/JS]

Deployment: [e.g., Vercel, Netlify, S3/CloudFront]

### 3.2. Backend Services

(Repeat for each significant backend service. Add more as needed.)

#### 3.2.1. [Service Name 1]

Name: [e.g., User Management Service, Data Processing API]

Description: [Briefly describe its purpose, e.g., "Handles user authentication and profile management."]

Technologies: [e.g., Node.js (Express), Python (Django/Flask), Java (Spring Boot), Go]

Deployment: [e.g., AWS EC2, Kubernetes, Serverless (Lambda/Cloud Functions)]

#### 3.2.2. [Service Name 2]

Name: [e.g., Analytics Service, Notification Service]
